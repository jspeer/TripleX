Functions
* \n is new line escape sequence for strings
* You must specify the return type of a function
* void to return no data
* Must be implemented before it is executed

Returning data from Functions
* while loop to execute a code block repeatedly
* ctrl-c to exit a program
* functions that are not of type void must contain a return statement for all exit paths of the function
* bool = true or false value

Function Parameters
* Increment variables like: ++MyVariable;
* Think about where you declare your variables
    * because of variable scope
* Function parameters allow us to pass values into it
* Passing values is known as passing an argument

Comparision operators
    equal to ==
    not equal to !=
    greater than >
    less than < 
    greater than or equal to >=
    less than or equal to <=
Can be used for conditions
    * Like in while and if
Make sure spacing is consistent
