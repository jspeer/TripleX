Preprocessor directive
* Instructions to the compiler
* Used to include a library before compiling
* We want it to be at the start of our file
* # represents preprocessor directive in our code

#include <iostream>
Preprocessor directive is to include, iostream is a headerfile

* instructing the compiler to copy the contents of the iostream header file into our code before the rest of our code is compiled

std::cout << "Hello, World"
std is a namespace, :: is a scope operator, cout is defined in the std namespace
* Namespace avoids the conflict of code being the same name!
* << takes the thing from the right and makes it input to the thing on the left
* "Hello World" is the string
