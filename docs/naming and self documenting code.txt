Naming and Self Documenting Code
* Self document code with goog naming
* Must begin with a letter or an underscore
* You must not use a reserved keyword
* Unreal's naming convention UpperCamelCase
* Right click and "change all occurences" in VS Code to rename and replace variables everywhere in a file

Variable Naming
* Important to give your variables good names
* Must begin with a letter or an underscore
    * cannot start with a number
* You must not use a reserved keyword
* Reserved keywords are to be used by the c++ language only
    * Over 90 keywords

Self documenting code
* Makes our code easier to read and understand
* If we give a variable a good name, we don't hav eto use a comment to explain what it does.

Unreals coding standard
* Unreal Engine 4 uses an UpperCamelCase naming convention
    * myVariable (bad) MyVariable (Good)
