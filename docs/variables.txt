Variables
* used to store data
* To use variables in c++ you must first declare them in your code
* By declaring a variable you are reserving space in the computer's memory for it

Variable declaration
int a = 0; // initialized variable
int is data type, a is variable name, 0 is the initializing value
* Variables can be initialized or uninitialized eg: int a;

* You declare variables in code
* A variable with a given value is initialized
* Declaring a variable = reserved space in memory
* You can add/multiply with arithmetic Operators
* Print to the terminal like: std::cout << a;
