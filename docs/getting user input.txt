std::cout << "Hello World"
cout = character output
<< = insertion operator

std::cin >> variable
cin = character input
>> = extration operator

Characters like 'x' get converted to 0 with integers
Characters like 'x' will halt cin from working until reset

* We want the players to enter numbers only
* They can enter numbers on seperate lines
* Or the same line separated by spaces
* We need to add a fix later in case anything other than a number gets entered & for replayability
