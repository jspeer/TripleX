Why int main()?
* Every c++ program requires int main()
* It is the starting point of a c++ program
* Without it, your program will not build!

Functions return values
* `int main` tells that it returns an integer
* `()` is where arguments go
* `{}` is where the body of the function goes

int main() & White Space
* int main() required in every c++ program
* Without int main() a c++ program will not run!
* We return 0 to signal program has run sucessfully
* Compiler ignores white Space
* Code style improves readability!
