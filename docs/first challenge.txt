Explain our main() function
* Explain our main() function best you constants
* Don't worry how much / little you know
* The purpose os twofold
* Firstly: to be brave, it counts for a lot
* Secondly: to record your starting point

My understanding of main()
* main() is the standardized call by the compiler as the starting point of any application
* main() is responsible for tying in the start to the rest of the application, such as any functions and external calls

Specifically for the code displayed in the video
[code]
    int main()
    {
        int difficulty = 2;
        int maxDifficuluty = 10;
        while (difficulty <= maxDifficuluty)
        {
            PlayGameAtDifficulty(difficulty);
            std::cin.clear();  // clears the failbit
            std::cin.ignore(); // discards the buffer
            ++difficulty;
        }

        std::cout << "WOW - You're a master hacker!\n";
        return 0; // exit with no error code
    }
[/code]
* Define starting difficulty variable as an integer with a value of 2, and maximum difficulty variable as an integer with a value of 10
* Create a while loop with the following test. If the difficulty is less than or equal to the maximum difficulty, then proceed through the loop.
** Call function PlayGameAtDifficulty with the parameter variable difficulty
** The next two lines are part of std, I don't know this yet.
** Increment difficulty by 1.
* After the loop ends, it outputs a message then exits with error code 0, which is the standard to represent there were no errors.
