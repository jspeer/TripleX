Variables
* `=` is an assignment operator
* Variables can be changed at runtime
* After a variable has been declared, we can assign a new value to it at any point in our code
* "A value that is subject to change"

Assigning values to variables
* We cannot assign a value to a variable before the variable has been declared
* The compiler will not be aware that the variable exists if you try assigning to it before it's declaration
* The compiler will not allow this!

const (short for constant)
* With the const keyword, we signal our intentions to ourselves and to anybody who reads our code:
    "We never want this variable to change it's value after it's declaration"
* Compiler = best friend. It protects our code.
